  <p>Assignment: Resume Using Skeleton</p>
  <p> Description: Making a responsive Resume using the Skeleton Boilerplate css</p>
  <p> Reflection: <br> <br> Skeleton is great for making responsive, mobile-friendly websites. Skeleton can help you quickly develop websites that look great at any size.  A great part about Skeleton is that is extremely easy to learn and use. For me it was easy to center and format content using the grid system. It's very easy to create a custom formatted website. All you have to do is use the container and row class, then use the preset classes to specify where certain content will be. Then it automatically resizes the content for you based on screen size. It also automatically styles elements such as button, table, and form to look much better than if you were just using html. Using skeleton is easier than using media quieries because the skeleton css grid system class automatically resizies content.  It is really convienient. You dont have to worry about creating classes and divs and then edit them each individually when styling in different media quieres.  However some of its weaknesses is that it does seem better for smaller projects.  Adittonally, updating may cause conflicts with your code. And if you dont update, you may risk falling behind.  Also, Skeleton has a limited number of templates, components and styles.  And skeleton doesn't give any javascript.

  <p>Assignment: Flexbox Assignment</p>
  <p> Description:  Create a responsive web page with Flexbox </p>
  <p> Reflection: <br> Flexbox makes it easy to create a fluid, responsive layout.  Flexbox is great because it saves you from writing lots of extra code to style items.  Consequently, using Flexbox will save you time and can make your code more clean and easier to read.  With just a few lines of code you can easily arrange, scale, order, align, wrap, and collapse items, without having to write a ton of css styling or complex computations.  Additionally, Flexbox is great because you can make certain items respond to what available space is left on the page.  You can simply allocate a certain amount of space that an item can take up.  Moreover, Flexbox can tell items to distribute space evenly. Flexbox is also good for easily centering elements, and controlling vertical and horizontal alignment.  In my opinion I don’t see any downsides to using Flexbox.  It's a great skill to know when programming websites. The only con I see is that Flexbox can be a bit confusing to learn.</p>

  <p>Assignment: Bootstrap Website</p>
  <p> Description: Create a SPA  website for a business, museum or non-profit organization of your choice using the Bootstrap framework.</p>
  <p> Reflection: <br> There are many benefits to using the bootstrap grid system.  Bootstrap makes it quite easy to learn how make a professional looking website.  It's easy to use and very customizable.  It also saves a lot of time on extra coding.  Bootstrap can save you from having to write a ton of extra CSS styling code, rather than having to build it from scratch.  It has it’s own custom designed css with tons of customization options. Also, it provides and extensive amount of  prebuilt  templates to work with and build off of.   It’s easy to style items and content by using bootstraps prebuilt classes.  A big plus is that bootstrap is compatible and completely responsive for every different type of screen sizes.  It’s also compatible with pretty much every browser.  Another great benefit of using bootstrap is that everything is extremely responsive.   Bootstrap already has programmed built in media queries so you don’t have to worry about them, which very is nice.  Easy to style and resize content without having to rely solely on writing your own css and media queries.  Through responsive utility classes, bootstrap features enable you to hide, show or manipulate a certain section of content due to a particular screen You can make the content appear in different ways based on different screen sizes or devices.  It makes the layout arrange and adjust to the way you want based on screen size. This allows certain preset breakpoints to adjust and change the layout or appearance of your website content. appear in different ways on different screen sizes or devices.
<br>
I honestly don’t see many weaknesses to bootstrap, other than the fact that you should know javascript and jquery to be able maximize customization and functionality.  Another thing I would kind of consider a weakness, is that the copious amount of classes can get confusing.  This can lead to cluttered, and messy code.  Therefore it could potentially make debugging harder given the situation.  Additionally, some things may not work if you forget to update to the latest bootstrap cdn.  Also, it takes a while to learn what all the classes do and how to properly use them.  In my opinion it was easier to learn the Skeleton grid system, since it’s not as powerful and doesn’t have thousands of features and class names to remember.
  In comparison to skeleton, I believe bootstrap is better than skeleton in most cases.  Unlike skeleton, which has not been updated in over 2 years, the bootstrap framework is constantly being updated. Skeleton is also not very rich in css and has limited templates compared to bootstrap.  This is due to skeleton being so lightweight.  Skeleton is more lightweight and easier to learn and understand but the catch is that it is much less powerful and is limited in features in comparison to bootstrap, Therefore, skeleton is not as useful for complex website design and functionality. The grid system has the similar 12-column grid like that of skeletons but bootstrap is different because you can hide or change, or relocate a certain section of content based on the particular screen size.  It’s similar to using media queries to tell items when to change based on screen size.  However, it's much easier,  more adaptable, and can make your productivity increase by saving you a lot of time.
<br>
  Bootstrap is more simple and faster to use because you don’t have to use media queries. You can just use the predefined classes to tell the content what to do and when to do it.  Unlike skeleton, bootstrap is developed to instantly be compatible with all screen sizes.  It's much better than structuring styling from scratch.  For smaller projects skeleton and media queries will suit your needs, while as for more complex projects, bootstrap is the ideal choice.

  <p>Assignment: SASS</p>
  <p> Description: Setup the Prime Properties web site files website so that it uses the Sass CSS preprocessor.</p>
  <p> Reflection: <br> Sass is an extremely beneficial extension to css.  There are many benefits to using sass.  It adds more features, abilities, and additional power to css. Sass gives you the ability to use variables, mixins, and functions. Variables are very useful because they allow you to store a value or multiple values. Once you define a variable it is easy to reuse the variable throughout your entire sass project.  Variables can also save you from repeating the same code.  Mixins are also extremely useful; you can call them anywhere within your sass project.  Mixins are very similar to functions.  You can add parameters and variables, logic like if statements, or whatever else you can think of.  Both mixins and functions both preform a certain defined task when called.  Functions also can come in handy in many situations, such as making random colors or sizes. The ability to use variables, mixins, and functions is great for larger and more complex projects because it makes things more clear, less complicated, easier to debug, and less cluttered.  Additionally, the terminal will catch any errors you’ve made and will indicate and display where you made the error. Furthermore it will offer a suggestion on what to correct, which is really cool. The terminal will also indicate when the scss has successfully converted to css.  I think these features are awesome.  Plus sass is constantly maintained and kept up to date by hundreds of professional developers.  I don’t think there are many weaknesses of sass at all.  I could go as far as to say that sass doesn’t have any weaknesses whatsoever.  In my opinion, everything it does is beneficial.  The only thing I had trouble with was setting it up.  For me it was pretty tricky and obscure to set it up and get it up and running.  However, once it’s set up it works easy.  Also I think its a bit odd that you have to keep the terminal running the whole time or else ruby stops running the sass converter.  Other than that I think sass is amazing and very useful.  I will definitely be using it in my future projects.</p>
